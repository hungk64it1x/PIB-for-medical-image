# Copy Paste positive polyp using poisson image blending for medical image segmentation

### According [poisson image blending](https://www.cs.jhu.edu/~misha/Fall07/Papers/Perez03.pdf) I've completely used it for biomedical image segmentation to increase dataset. Because Polyps segementation dataset does not enough have. <br> Wheares there are many tasks in medical using image to diagnose. This will help the doctors reduce time and pressure ðŸ’ª
------------------------------------
### 1. Some examples of PIB copy paste

â€¢ I think this type is so cool! <br> You can see new image after copy paste really like a real picture ðŸ˜„

-----------------------------------
### 2. How to run
```
git clone https://github.com/hungk64it1x/PIB-for-medical-image
```
#### install requirements
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
or for Linux
```
sudo apt install -r requirements.txt
```
after that you should modify the image source (contain positive region) in file run.py from line 84 -> 89 because my implement that for Kvasir, Colon, Etis, Clinic and EndoScene dataset.
<br>Finally run run.py to generate copy image:
```
python3 run.py --image_dir [directory of image] --mask_dir [directory of mask] --save_image_dir [path save images] --save_mask_dir [path save masks] --num_images [number of image to generate]
```
